# Cybersecurity Knowledge Base - Repository Overview

Welcome to the **Cybersecurity Knowledge Base**, a modular and scalable archive of theory, tools, and professional insights from across the cybersecurity domain. This repository is focused on **knowledge**, **concepts**, and **practical understanding**, separate from labs or architectural projects.

## üìÅ Folder Structure

### `tools/`
This section provides in-depth documentation of cybersecurity tools. Each file may cover:
- Overview of the tool and its intended use
- Command-line syntax or interface walkthroughs
- Practical examples of real-world usage
- Tips, advanced flags, and use cases
- Integration into workflows or automation scripts

### `protocols/`
Detailed reference and explanation of key network protocols, focusing on their role in cybersecurity:
- Protocol architecture and flow
- Security considerations (e.g., weaknesses or typical misuse)
- Packet structures or negotiation sequences
- Real-world examples of exploitation or misconfiguration

### `concepts/`
A breakdown of essential cybersecurity models and paradigms:
- Frameworks (e.g., Zero Trust, CIA Triad, MITRE ATT&CK)
- Best practices and guiding principles
- Conceptual comparisons (e.g., symmetric vs. asymmetric encryption)
- Use case-driven learning for each concept

### `vulnerabilities/`
Exploration of common vulnerabilities, both theoretical and practical:
- Technical breakdowns (causes, exploit paths, payloads)
- Real-world CVE case studies
- Detection techniques and tools
- Mitigation strategies and patches

### `red-team/`
Focused on offensive security and adversarial thinking:
- Attack phases and tactics (recon, initial access, privilege escalation, etc.)
- Offensive tooling and their methodologies
- Payload crafting and evasion techniques
- Post-exploitation, persistence, and pivoting strategies

### `blue-team/`
Covers defensive measures and detection strategies:
- Log analysis, threat hunting, and SIEM configurations
- Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) tuning
- Incident response planning and playbooks
- Hardening practices and audit checklists

### `iam/`
Documentation of identity management and access control practices:
- Protocols (OAuth2, SAML, LDAP)
- Federation, SSO, MFA explanations
- Identity lifecycle and role management
- PAM and IAM product evaluations or configurations

### `cloud/`
Topics specific to cloud infrastructure and services:
- Cloud platform configurations (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Shared responsibility model breakdowns
- Cloud-native tools and service security
- Identity, networking, encryption, and logging in cloud

### `productivity/`
Time-saving tips and operational shortcuts:
- Bash/Powershell snippets
- Alias files, automation scripts
- Cheatsheets for frequent tasks or tool flags
- Keyboard shortcuts and optimized workflow habits

### `work-experience/`
Anecdotal or professional records of real security problems and resolutions:
- Lessons learned from incidents or projects
- Setup notes or troubleshooting logs
- Cross-team interactions and integrations
- Analysis of tools and techniques used on the job

## Contribution Guidelines
This repository is written for **self-study**, **sharing**, and **growth**. Each `.md` file should:
- Be clear and structured (use headings, lists, code blocks)
- Focus on the *why* and *how*, not just definitions
- Optionally include references or diagrams

Feel free to fork and adapt the structure to your needs.
