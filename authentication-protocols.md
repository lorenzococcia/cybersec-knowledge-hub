# Guide to Authentication and Authorization Protocols

This guide is designed to help you understand the key differences between **OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect (OIDC)** and other alternatives, focusing on **real-world use cases**, **user experience**, **security**, and **practical applicability**.

---

## Introduction

Authentication and authorization are two fundamental concepts in cybersecurity:

* **Authentication**: "Who are you?"
* **Authorization**: "Are you allowed to do this?"

Protocols like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect are often used together, but they serve **different purposes**. There are also alternative protocols (such as SAML and WS-Federation) that meet specific needs, especially in enterprise contexts.

## OAuth 2.0

### What it is:

OAuth 2.0 is an **authorization framework** that allows an application to obtain limited access to a user's protected resources.

### Key Features:

* Issues **access tokens**
* Does **not** identify the user (not an authentication protocol)
* Supports different grant types: Authorization Code, Client Credentials, Resource Owner Password, etc.

### Pros:

* Simple to implement for API access
* Widely supported
* Extendable via standards like JWT and Token Exchange (RFC 8693)

### Cons:

* Does not provide user identity information
* Can be misused when authentication is needed

### Ideal Use Cases:

* App-to-App interactions (no human user)
* Delegating access to an API (e.g., accessing Google Drive on behalf of a user)

---

## OpenID Connect (OIDC)

### What it is:

An **authentication layer** built on top of OAuth 2.0. It allows applications to verify a user's identity and retrieve basic profile information (claims).

### Key Features:

* Extends OAuth 2.0 with ID Token
* Supports Discovery, Dynamic Client Registration, UserInfo Endpoint

### Pros:

* Modern standard for federated SSO
* Secure for native apps via browser-based flows (RFC 8252)
* Used by major identity providers (Google, Apple, Microsoft)

### Cons:

* Requires browser mediation for mobile app security
* More complex setup than pure OAuth 2.0

### Ideal Use Cases:

* Social or federated login
* Centralized user authentication (SSO)

---

## SAML 2.0 (Security Assertion Markup Language)

### What it is:

An XML-based protocol for **federated SSO**, widely used in enterprise environments.

### Key Features:

* Uses digitally signed XML assertions
* Facilitates authentication between Identity Providers (IdP) and Service Providers (SP)

### Pros:

* Mature and enterprise-proven
* Strong support for signing and encryption

### Cons:

* Verbose XML syntax
* Poor fit for mobile or RESTful APIs

### Ideal Use Cases:

* Integration with Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS)
* Organization-to-organization SSO

---

## WS-Federation

### What it is:

A Microsoft-origin protocol for federated identity, similar to SAML but with a different syntax.

### Key Features:

* XML-based
* Integrated into older Microsoft .NET environments

### Pros:

* Strong integration with Microsoft technologies

### Cons:

* Complex and considered outdated in modern applications
* Limited modern support

### Ideal Use Cases:

* Legacy Microsoft environments

---

## Passkeys / WebAuthn

### What it is:

A modern passwordless authentication standard based on public-key cryptography, supported by most major browsers.

### Key Features:

* Enables biometric or hardware-based authentication
* No password transmission involved

### Pros:

* Extremely secure
* Modern and streamlined user experience

### Cons:

* Requires compatible devices
* Adoption still growing

### Ideal Use Cases:

* Passwordless login on modern websites
* Strong multi-factor authentication

## When to Use Which Protocol: Summary Table

| Scenario                                 | Recommended Protocol           | Reasoning                                             |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Server-to-server API access              | OAuth 2.0 (Client Credentials) | No user involved, resource access only                |
| Web app Single Sign-On                   | OpenID Connect or SAML 2.0     | Federated user authentication                         |
| Social login (Google, Apple, etc.)       | OpenID Connect                 | Identity and profile claims included                  |
| Native mobile apps                       | OAuth 2.0 + Token Exchange     | Better UX, avoids browser flows                       |
| Legacy systems integration               | SAML 2.0 / WS-Federation       | Compatibility with existing enterprise infrastructure |
| Passwordless authentication (biometrics) | WebAuthn / Passkeys            | Strong security and user experience                   |

## Conclusion

* **OAuth 2.0** is a highly flexible authorization foundation.
* **OIDC** extends OAuth for identity-centric use cases.
* **SAML and WS-Federation** remain relevant in enterprise and legacy integrations.
* **WebAuthn** is the emerging standard for secure, passwordless authentication.

Choosing the right protocol depends on the **use case**, **desired user experience**, and **infrastructure constraints**.
